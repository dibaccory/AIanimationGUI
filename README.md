## Application Instructions
- Right panel customizes network
  * Add layers, reset model
  * Change colors
  * Turn off training visualization updates
- Train button: train network in real time on dataset
- Current button: refreshes visualization to most recent weights
- Prev and Next: Move through the dataset and visualize input into the network
- Hover over a neuron to see its input connections
- Hover over a layer slice (channel) to see it better
  * Click on the slice to keep other slices hidden

## Roadmap:

- Color connections
- Visibility
- Dataset performance evaluation
- Drag and drop layers into the model
- Import/Export models in python
- Provide more datasets
- Visualization tools
- Support larger networks, new layers
- Log and rank models
- Import and connect custom datasets
- <i>Aesthetics</i>
