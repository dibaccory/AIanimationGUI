# AIanimationGUI

Come one come all to the AI noob-enthusiasts' wet dream: The Artificial Intelligent Animation GU
I


TODO:
	1) Make the GUI: Based on which one you click, it'll open up the "inventory".
	2) Make the inventory items draggable.
	3) Make the "OK" submittable if the user passes certain constraints.
	4) Check that the user isn't making invalid moves. (ie: adding 2 input layers, etc)
	5) Add a "play" button?
	6) Add a URL field? (dream feature)
