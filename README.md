## Application Instructions
- Right panel customizes network
  * Add layers, reset model
  * Change colors
  * Turn off training visualization updates
- Train button: train network in real time on dataset
- Current button: refreshes visualization to most recent weights
- Prev and Next: Move through the dataset and visualize their input into the network
- Hover over a neuron to see its input connections
- Hover over a layer slice (channel) to see it better
  * Click on the slice to keep other slices hidden

## Roadmap:

- <del>Color connections</del>, visibility<br>
- Drag and drop layers together<br>
- Import/Export models<br>
- More datasets<br>
- Visualization tools<br>
- Large networks, new layers<br>
- Log and rank models<br>
- Import and connect datasets<br>
- <i>Aesthetics</i><br>
